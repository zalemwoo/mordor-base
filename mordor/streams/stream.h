/// Stream is the main interface for dealing with a stream of data.  It can
/// represent half or full duplex streams, as well as random access streams
/// or sequential only streams.  By default, a Stream advertises that it
/// cannot support any operations, and calling any of them will result in an
/// assertion.  close() and flush() are always safe to call.
///
/// Streams are not thread safe, except for cancelRead() and cancelWrite(),
/// and it is safe to call read() at the same time as write() (assuming the
/// Stream supports both, and don't supportSeek()).  read() and write() are
/// @b not re-entrant.
